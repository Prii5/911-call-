# 911 Calls Analysis

In this visual analysis I used few data visualization techniques while exploring this dataset. I used pandas to create a dataframes, look through it, reorganize it, and to graph most important data categories that I wanted to visualize. 

For the dataset, I found the EMS-related calls represented the most 911 calls, followed by traffic, and then fire. I found 2 outliers that occured on March 2nd, 2018 and November 15th, 2018, both were likely due to sever weather conditions (got to know about the severe weather condition after I looked up in the google for the probable reason for so many traffic calls).
