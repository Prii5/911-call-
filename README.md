# 911-call-

In this visual analysis I used few visualization techniques while exploring this dataset. I used pandas to create dataframes and shift through the data, reorganizing, extracting, and graphing important data categories that I want to visualize. 

For the dataset, we found the EMS-related calls represented the most 911 calls, followed by traffic and then fire. We found 2 outliers that occured on March 2nd, 2018 and November 15th, 2018, both were likely due to sever weather conditions(got to know about the severe weather condition after I looked up in the google for the probable reason for so many traffic calls).
